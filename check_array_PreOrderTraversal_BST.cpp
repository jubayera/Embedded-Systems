Check if a given array can represent Preorder Traversal of Binary Search Tree

Given an array of numbers, return true if given array can represent preorder traversal of a Binary Search Tree, else return false. Expected time complexity is O(n).

Examples:

Input:  pre[] = {2, 4, 3}
Output: true
Given array can represent preorder traversal
of below tree
    2
     
      4
     /
    3

Input:  pre[] = {2, 4, 1}
Output: false
Given array cannot represent preorder traversal
of a Binary Search Tree.

Input:  pre[] = {40, 30, 35, 80, 100}
Output: true
Given array can represent preorder traversal
of below tree
     40
   /   
 30    80 
        
  35     100 


Input:  pre[] = {40, 30, 35, 20, 80, 100}
Output: false
Given array cannot represent preorder traversal
of a Binary Search Tree.
A Simple Solution is to do following for every node pre[i] starting from first one.

1) Find the first greater value on right side of current node. 
   Let the index of this node be j. Return true if following 
   conditions hold. Else return false
    (i)  All values after the above found greater value are 
         greater than current node.
    (ii) Recursive calls for the subarrays pre[i+1..j-1] and 
         pre[j+1..n-1] also return true. 

Time Complexity of the above solution is O(n2)

An Efficient Solution can solve this problem in O(n) time. The idea is to use a stack. This problem is similar to Next (or closest) Greater Element problem. Here we find next greater element and after finding next greater, if we find a smaller element, then return false.
1) Create an empty stack.
2) Initialize root as INT_MIN.
3) Do following for every element pre[i]
     a) If pre[i] is smaller than current root, return false.
     b) Keep removing elements from stack while pre[i] is greater
        then stack top. Make the last removed item as new root (to
        be compared next).
        At this point, pre[i] is greater than the removed root
        (That is why if we see a smaller element in step a), we 
        return false)
     c) push pre[i] to stack (All elements in stack are in decreasing
        order)
